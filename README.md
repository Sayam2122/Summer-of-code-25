# Summer-of-code-25

This repository documents my learning journey during the Summer of Code 2025 (SOC’25), where I built a Face Detection model. As part of my preparation, I completed the **CS50P – Introduction to Programming with Python** course by HarvardX and explored essential Python libraries including **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.
